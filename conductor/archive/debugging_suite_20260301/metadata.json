  "description": "I need a palette viewer, a tile viewer, a sound chip visualizer, a memory viewer, CPU states for both chips, etc.; please make a comprehensive plan for all of this. Also, consider any other debugging functionality that an emulator designed for software developers to use to debug their Genesis/Mega Drive games and other utility software would need in order to be a comprehensive, one-stop shop. In addition, try to support multiple windows, so that UI elements don't bury the running game program."
